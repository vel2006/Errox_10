## How To work Errox_10

### Employee usage
On the computer you wish to access remotely as the admin, run the 'Installer.[ext]' file and the correct version depending on the operating system which on this repo are currently Windows and Linux, when running the script it will ask for admin access which it must have in the version 0.1.
