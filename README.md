# Errox_10

# IMPORTANT NOTICE!

## Errox_10 is changing languages, it is changing to Rust instead of C and Python for its memory safe features and speed. The transformation will start with the ending / main software, then slowly the installer will also be changed. This page is now outdated for information on how to do anything with this project, for information simply use the '--help' command inside of the avalable programs.

# Special Thanks To:
## BorderDestroyer, ARussianSpy, and Ott3r
BorderDestroyer has worked with me by running the several tests of software versions to make this all possible. I personally love his streams and he is my insperation to keep doing all this, he is the reason I even want to log onto my computer every day and try to outdo myself. Even with all the shit I give him in his Discord about his code, I simply wouldnt be where I am without him. Thank you Border. 
ARussianSpy has worked with me by testing the software before I send it to BorderDestroyer for it's public showings. They have been helping me by easing my anxiety by telling me what I need to fix, or if it is perfectly fine. I also wouldnt be able to make the programs I have without their help. Thank you Russian Spy.
Ott3r has tested my software for its instalation and helped by ironing out all the flukes in my software by showing it running publicly before I sent it to BorderDestroyer. Thank you Ott3r.
I would like to say, Thank you to my cybersecurity teacher, who has made Cybersecurity so easy to understand and enjoy. Thank you Sir. I do not believe I would have the skills I have in programing and cybersecurity without your help. Thank you sir.
Finnaly, thank you to the people who have helped me test this software in person. They have been of major help during the transformation of this project from something on the back burner, to now my main focus (outside of school, got to pass first). With their help I have been able to fix sevral issues in terms of local networking and resource usage. Thanks you mad lads.

While I dont have permition to place their information here, they are helping me lots by testing this software in it's transformation from C and Python to Rust! With their help I can iron out all the issues of "it doesnt work on my computer".
